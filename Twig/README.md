Filename: `SpecThemeExtension.php`

Status: Optional

Must: extends \Twig_Extension

Description: "The main motivation for writing an extension is to move often used code into a reusable class like adding
support for internationalization. An extension can define tags, filters, tests, operators, global variables, functions,
and node visitors. Creating an extension also makes for a better separation of code that is executed at compilation time
and code needed at runtime. As such, it makes your code faster."
